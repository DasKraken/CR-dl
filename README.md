# CR-dl
*Read this in other language*: [Deutsch](README.de.md)

CR-dl is a tool to quickly download anime from [Crunchyroll](http://www.crunchyroll.com/)

## Installation

Windows users can get a Windows bundle from the [Releases Page](https://github.com/DasKraken/CR-dl/releases).


### Without using the bundle:

CR-dl requires [node.js (v10 or later)](https://nodejs.org) and [ffmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org) to be installed on the system and available in PATH

After these are installed run:

    npm install -g https://github.com/DasKraken/CR-dl.git

now you can run it with ```cr-dl```

## Usage
CR-dl is a CLI-Tool and can only be run from the terminal. 

*Note:* If you use the Windows bundle with Powershell, instead of calling ```cr-dl```, you have to write it out: ```.\cr-dl.exe``` .

Following commands are available:


Log in into Crunchyroll to be get access to premium content (This will create a file 'cookies.data' to store the session):
```
cr-dl login <username> <password>
```


Log out:
```
cr-dl logout
```

Change the language of Crunchyroll. This will change the language of the metadata for file naming. 
Note 1: This wont change the default subtitle language.
Note 2: Series that aren't available in selected language may not work.
Allowed values are: enUS, enGB, esLA, esES, ptBR, ptPT, frFR, deDE, arME, itIT, ruRU

Additionally you can append **!scene** to the name e.g. ```{seasonTitle!scene}``` to make it a dot separated title as used in Scene releases.
